Examples

***Not all of the examples are meant to work without modification.***

The version suffix is only meant to indicate an alternate version
of the same example. e.g. `custom-headers-v2.js` is meant to be used
with the latest version of Cloudscraper, ***not*** Cloudscraper v2.0.0.

If you've noticed for some reason that an example is outdated and/or misleading, please send a PR to correct it.
